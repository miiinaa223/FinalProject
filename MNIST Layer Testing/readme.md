Project Title:
Deep Learning for image processing with Keras

Team Members:
Satyan, Jay, Mina, Ashraf

Project Description/Outline:
Using Fashion MNIST dataset, weâ€™ll define a CNN network with the Keras deep learning library, store them in Amazon AWS, and then train the data on the Fashion MNIST dataset, evaluate it, and review the results.
Reason For choosing Model:
Existing MINST Digit dataset is easy, overused and does not represent modern CV tasks. The purpose of our project is to confirm the success rate of classification of images and image recognition on complex data set MINST-fashion

Data Sets to be Used:
https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/tree/master/data/fashion

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Review data sources and decide any necessary cleaning
Create git repo, Jupyter Notebook, and import data
Explore data and decide on any additional directs for charts and graphs
Create dataframe and necessary python pandas code for visualizing data
Create final report and presentation

Tools will be used:
Machine Learning, Tensorflow (Keras), Google Cloud (Running the script), Amazon AWS (S3 - Storing data), Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib
