# Fashion MNIST with Keras and Deep Learning

Introduction
-----
We will train a Normal Neural Network and Deep Neural Network with Keras on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, to classify fashion images and categories. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is meant to be more challenging than the existing MNIST digit dataset that classify 0 - 9 digits.

The Fashion MNIST dataset includes:
60,000 training examples
10,000 testing examples
10 classes
28×28 grayscale/single channel images
*MNIST … (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database)

What are we trying to solve?
-----
We will compare the accuracy rate of Normal Neural Network (1 Hidden Layer of 100 Nodes) vs Deep Neural Network (2 Hidden Layers of 100 Nodes) on the same set of Training and Test Data. We are expecting Deep Neural Network to provide higher accuracy on Test Data when compared to Normal Neural Network. 

Result:
As per our analysis there is no difference in accuracy between Normal Neural Network and Deep Neural Network. 

Tool sets requirement:
-----
ML: Image processing

Tools used: 
ML - Tensorflow (Keras), Google Colab, Amazon AWS (S3), Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib
